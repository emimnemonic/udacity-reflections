When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm working with a team of developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To decide what changes you want to keep.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clones refer to copying and downloading an entire repository into your local machine, whereas forks are essentially cloning but on GitHub. Branches are paths that you create when you want to make changes to the code without tampering with the original code. They can exist in github or locally.
